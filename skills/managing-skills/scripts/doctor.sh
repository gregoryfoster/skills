# managing-skills-doctor: do not remove this marker — install-doctor.sh greps it
# doctor.sh — diagnose and self-heal dangling skill and hook symlinks.
#
# When this repo is vendored via the managing-skills git-submodule + symlink
# pattern, a consumer checkout that hasn't initialized submodules
# (fresh `git worktree add`, shallow CI clone, etc.) leaves the
# .claude/skills/<name> → ../../skills/<name> → ../skills-vendor/.../<name>
# chain dangling. Scripts referenced from SKILL.md then fail with confusing
# "No such file or directory" errors even though the symlinks exist.
#
# This script is installed as a real (non-symlinked) file at
# <repo-root>/.skills/doctor.sh so it remains reachable even when the
# vendor chain is broken. It walks skills/* and .claude/hooks/* symlinks,
# attempts a `git submodule update --init --recursive` if any dangle, and
# prints a clear actionable error if self-healing fails.
#
# A dangling symlink is not the only way the vendor chain breaks, and for a
# long time it was the only one this script could see (issue #185). "Every
# symlink resolves" was standing in for "the submodules are healthy", and the
# two come apart in the state issue #176 was found in: vendored content still
# on disk from an earlier checkout, .git/config carrying no submodule.*
# entries. Every symlink resolves, so the doctor exited 0 before reaching its
# own init and the checkout stayed half-healed indefinitely — one consumer sat
# there for days. So the heal has a second trigger: any skills-vendor/
# submodule `git submodule status` still prefixes with '-'.
#
# .claude/hooks/ is in scope because skill installers link hooks there too
# (issue #99). A dangling skills/<name> surfaces only when that skill is
# invoked; a dangling hook symlink surfaces on every Edit|Write|MultiEdit —
# the highest-frequency tool event there is — as exit 127 naming a path that
# `ls` plainly shows exists. Same failure class, different directory, and one
# heal path covers any future hook a skill installs.
#
# Because the installed copy is a copy, it re-syncs itself from the vendored
# source whenever that source is reachable — see sync_self below.
#
# Designed for use as a Phase 1 preflight in every reviewing-* / shipping-*
# SKILL.md invocation. The doctor runs first so that the resolution loop that
# follows sees a freshly healed symlink chain (issue #63):

Diagnose and self-heal dangling symlinks in skills/ and .claude/hooks/.

If any symlink in those directories does not resolve and a .git directory
is present, runs 'git submodule update --init --recursive' and re-checks.
Exits 0 silently when healthy. Exits non-zero with an actionable error
when self-healing fails or is not possible (e.g. no .git directory).

The same repair also runs when every symlink resolves but a skills-vendor/
submodule is uninitialized — content on disk, nothing registered in
.git/config. Resolving symlinks do not imply healthy submodules, and that
half-healed checkout is the one nothing else detects. A submodule that
.gitmodules holds with 'update = none' is exempt and stays uninitialized
through any repair; one that is not held fails the doctor, in --check-only
because no repair was attempted and after the heal because one was.

.claude/hooks/ is scanned because skill installers link hooks there into
the same vendor chain; a dangling one fails on every file edit rather than
only when a skill is invoked.

Every hook symlink that resolves is also checked for its SessionStart
registration in .claude/settings.json, which is the half that makes it
run at all. The repair printed comes from a one-line <hook>.install
manifest the vendoring skill ships beside the script, so a skill adding a
hook needs no edit here. Advisory by default: it warns and leaves the
exit code alone, because a wiring gap is not a dangling symlink and
Phase 1 preflights gate on that code. Under --check-only the same state
exits 1 — that mode is a deliberate probe, not a review preflight, so a
CI job can finally gate on the wiring (#231). For per-hook gating, loop
install-hook.sh --check instead: it exits 3 per half-installed hook.

Re-syncs .skills/doctor.sh from the vendored source under skills-vendor/
when the two differ, so upstream fixes reach consumers that did not
install the auto-refresh hook. Best-effort — never affects the exit code;
failures are reported only under --verbose. The refresh applies from the
following run. Skipped entirely under --check-only, which makes no writes.

When submodule init fails with a well-known SSH/HTTPS auth signature
(Permission denied, Could not read from remote repository, Authentication
failed for 'https://'), a targeted remediation block is printed instead
of the generic 'submodule update failed' line. The same block is printed
by the pre-flight SSH check when .gitmodules references SSH remotes and
the agent isn't reachable from this shell. A separate remediation block
covers host-key-verification failures (ssh-keyscan-based fix).

Options:
  --check-only    Report broken symlinks, uninitialized skills-vendor/
                  submodules and unregistered hooks but make no changes:
                  no submodule init, no self-sync. Exits 1 for any of the
                  three, EXCEPT a submodule .gitmodules holds with
                  'update = none' — the exit code covers everything this
                  mode reports as damage, including the wiring gap the
                  default invocation only warns about (#231). (The
                  archive-checkout path when .git is absent overrides the
                  reporting, printing its own diagnosis — it makes no
                  changes either.)
  --no-preflight  Skip the SSH pre-flight ping. Useful when the operator
                  knows the agent state and doesn't want the 3-second
                  ConnectTimeout on every invocation.
  --verbose, -v   Print resolution details even when healthy.
  --version       Print the script's diagnostic version stamp and exit.
  --help, -h      Show this help and exit.

Exit codes:
  0  All scanned symlinks resolve (or neither directory exists).
  1  One or more symlinks remain broken after self-heal attempt, or
     pre-flight SSH check failed. Under --check-only, also: an installed
     hook that .claude/settings.json does not register (#231).
  2  Invalid invocation (e.g. unknown flag).

# An installed hook's contract is TWO artifacts — the symlink and the
# SessionStart registration in .claude/settings.json — and only the second one
# makes it run. A repo carrying the symlink without the registration looks
# installed to anyone who lists .claude/hooks/ and runs nothing.
#
# Four of twelve audited consumers were in exactly that state for the refresh
# hook, pinned at one commit for over a week while the rest of the cohort moved
# through four skill versions (#167). Nothing detected it, because a
# half-installed hook is silent by construction: the missing half is the half
# that would have run.
#
# EVERY hook, not the one this check was written for (#224). It was hardcoded
# to skills-submodule-update.sh, so a consumer with three installed hooks and
# zero registrations had one of the three reported and the two init-socraticode
# hooks were undetectable. socraticode-health.sh is the worst one to lose that
# way — it is silent when clean by design, so "installed, unregistered, never
# runs" and "installed, registered, nothing to report" produce byte-identical
# observable behaviour. The repo that most needs the check is the one that
# cannot tell it stopped. Paired with #222, which deletes a registration
# silently, the two were a complete silent-failure loop.
#
# Reported HERE, for the same reason sync_self lives here — the doctor is the
# one code path that still runs in a repo whose hooks do not, whether through a
# reviewing-*/shipping-* preflight or a SessionStart entry of its own. Warn
# only; a wiring gap is not a dangling symlink and must not change this
# script's exit code, which Phase 1 preflights gate on with `|| exit 1`.

# The per-hook manifest a skill ships beside the script it installs: one line of
# install-hook.sh arguments, printed as the repair (#224).

# constants would sit in a different skill from the hook they configure — the
# opposite of where #200 moved them. A manifest costs a file per hook and no
# edits ever.

doctor: the auth check above failed — auth to one of the submodule
remotes was refused. Common causes (and fixes):

  1. SSH agent not reachable from this shell.
       ssh-add -l
     "Error connecting to authentication agent" → start the agent and
     re-add keys.

  2. Agent has no identities loaded.
     Add the default key (macOS keychain integration):
       ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     (adjust the key path if yours isn't id_ed25519 — `ls ~/.ssh/id_*`
     shows what's available.)
     And persist via ~/.ssh/config so the key auto-loads:
       Host github.com
         AddKeysToAgent yes
         UseKeychain yes
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

  3. Auth works in your terminal but not from a wrapper script.
       ssh -T git@github.com
     If that succeeds interactively but fails here, a wrapper in the
     chain (e.g. dev.sh) is scrubbing SSH_AUTH_SOCK from the env.

  4. Public submodule, no SSH credentials available.
     Force HTTPS for github.com globally (affects ALL repos on this
     machine — use only if you understand the scope):
       git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf "git@github.com:"

doctor: SSH refused to talk to one of the submodule remotes because its
