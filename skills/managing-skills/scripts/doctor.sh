#
# When this repo is vendored via the managing-skills git-submodule + symlink
# pattern, a consumer checkout that hasn't initialized submodules
# (fresh `git worktree add`, shallow CI clone, etc.) leaves the
# .claude/skills/<name> → ../../skills/<name> → ../skills-vendor/.../<name>
# chain dangling. Scripts referenced from SKILL.md then fail with confusing
# "No such file or directory" errors even though the symlinks exist.
#
# This script is installed as a real (non-symlinked) file at
# <repo-root>/.skills/doctor.sh so it remains reachable even when the
# vendor chain is broken. It walks skills/* and .claude/hooks/* symlinks,
# attempts a `git submodule update --init --recursive` if any dangle, and
# prints a clear actionable error if self-healing fails.
#
# A dangling symlink is not the only way the vendor chain breaks, and for a
# long time it was the only one this script could see (issue #185). "Every
# symlink resolves" was standing in for "the submodules are healthy", and the
# two come apart in the state issue #176 was found in: vendored content still
# on disk from an earlier checkout, .git/config carrying no submodule.*
# entries. Every symlink resolves, so the doctor exited 0 before reaching its
# own init and the checkout stayed half-healed indefinitely — one consumer sat
# there for days. So the heal has a second trigger: any skills-vendor/
# submodule `git submodule status` still prefixes with '-'.
#
# .claude/hooks/ is in scope because skill installers link hooks there too
# (issue #99). A dangling skills/<name> surfaces only when that skill is
# invoked; a dangling hook symlink surfaces on every Edit|Write|MultiEdit —
# the highest-frequency tool event there is — as exit 127 naming a path that
# `ls` plainly shows exists. Same failure class, different directory, and one
# heal path covers any future hook a skill installs.
#
# Because the installed copy is a copy, it re-syncs itself from the vendored
# source whenever that source is reachable — see sync_self below.
#
# Designed for use as a Phase 1 preflight in every reviewing-* / shipping-*

Diagnose and self-heal dangling symlinks in skills/ and .claude/hooks/.

If any symlink in those directories does not resolve and a .git directory
is present, runs 'git submodule update --init --recursive' and re-checks.
Exits 0 silently when healthy. Exits non-zero with an actionable error
when self-healing fails or is not possible (e.g. no .git directory).

The same repair also runs when every symlink resolves but a skills-vendor/
submodule is uninitialized — content on disk, nothing registered in
.git/config. Resolving symlinks do not imply healthy submodules, and that
half-healed checkout is the one nothing else detects. A submodule that
.gitmodules holds with 'update = none' is exempt and stays uninitialized
through any repair; one that is not held fails the doctor, in --check-only
because no repair was attempted and after the heal because one was.

.claude/hooks/ is scanned because skill installers link hooks there into
the same vendor chain; a dangling one fails on every file edit rather than
only when a skill is invoked.

Every hook symlink that resolves is also checked for its SessionStart
registration in .claude/settings.json, which is the half that makes it
run at all. The repair printed comes from a one-line <hook>.install
manifest the vendoring skill ships beside the script, so a skill adding a
hook needs no edit here. Advisory by default: it warns and leaves the
exit code alone, because a wiring gap is not a dangling symlink and
Phase 1 preflights gate on that code. Under --check-only the same state
exits 1 — that mode is a deliberate probe, not a review preflight, so a
CI job can finally gate on the wiring (#231). For per-hook gating, loop
install-hook.sh --check instead: it exits 3 per half-installed hook.

Local overrides are regular directories, not part of the symlink chain,
but two things about them are checked anyway (#238). Their per-script
symlinks (skills/<override>/scripts/*) join the dangling scan: they are
how an override tracks the scripts it does not change, and an upstream
rename or deletion strands them while every top-level symlink still
resolves. And each override's SKILL.md frontmatter is compared against
its overrides: target — warning when the recorded version (the vendor
version LAST SYNCED FROM, bumped on every re-sync; or the synced-from:
commit for vendors that ship no version) has fallen behind the vendor
copy. Drift is advisory in every mode including --check-only, and
nothing is ever auto-merged: the point of an override is that upstream
text cannot be applied blindly.

That version comparison checks the STAMP. It cannot see divergence at
the SAME version — an override synced honestly from v1.1 whose text
dropped a fix v1.1 contains — and #63 was reintroduced a second time
through that opening (#260). So each override's SKILL.md is also read,
whatever its stamp says, for two things:

  - fragments the vendor FENCES as required. Upstream marks a block
    <!-- skill:required --> when dropping it reintroduces a fixed
    failure; an override must carry each one, compared insensitive to
    whitespace. Only fenced code blocks, and only what upstream marks —
    an override is supposed to differ, so this is not a diff.
  - a bare "bash scripts/X.sh" invocation INSIDE A FENCED CODE BLOCK,
    where it is an instruction to execute. The agent's cwd is the
    project root and a skill's scripts/ ships inside the skill, so that
    path opens nothing (#63). A script that cd's to the toplevel does
    not fix it: that resolves the root it operates on, not the path
    bash uses to open the file. Prose is not scanned: an override
    carrying upstream's own warning against the pattern was reported
    as committing it.

Both are advisory in every mode, like the drift check they sit beside.

A vendored file committed as a REGULAR FILE where the vendor ships one of
the same name is reported as silently forked (#256) — it stops tracking
upstream forever and nothing else detects it. Only inside a skills/<name>
that is a real directory: a whole-directory symlink cannot fork, and a
declared override is local by definition. The walk covers the skill's own
*.md plus one level under each of scripts/, references/ and assets/ — a
fork nested deeper than that is not seen. pre-ship.sh is exempt by name
(consumers are expected to supply their own), and any other deliberate
divergence is declared one repo-relative path per line in
.skills/forked-ok. Advisory in every mode, and never healed: a fork is
sometimes the right answer, so the operator decides.

Re-syncs .skills/doctor.sh from the vendored source under skills-vendor/
when the two differ, so upstream fixes reach consumers that did not
install the auto-refresh hook. Best-effort — never affects the exit code;
failures are reported only under --verbose. The refresh applies from the
following run. Skipped entirely under --check-only, which makes no writes.

When submodule init fails with a well-known SSH/HTTPS auth signature
(Permission denied, Could not read from remote repository, Authentication
failed for 'https://'), a targeted remediation block is printed instead
of the generic 'submodule update failed' line. The same block is printed
by the pre-flight SSH check when .gitmodules references SSH remotes and
the agent isn't reachable from this shell. A separate remediation block
covers host-key-verification failures (ssh-keyscan-based fix).

Options:
  --check-only    Report broken symlinks, uninitialized skills-vendor/
                  submodules and unregistered hooks but make no changes:
                  no submodule init, no self-sync. Exits 1 for any of the
                  three, EXCEPT a submodule .gitmodules holds with
                  'update = none' — the exit code covers everything this
                  mode reports as damage, including the wiring gap the
                  default invocation only warns about (#231). (The
                  archive-checkout path when .git is absent overrides the
                  reporting, printing its own diagnosis — it makes no
                  changes either.)
  --no-preflight  Skip the SSH pre-flight ping. Useful when the operator
                  knows the agent state and doesn't want the 3-second
                  ConnectTimeout on every invocation.
  --verbose, -v   Print resolution details even when healthy.
  --version       Print the script's diagnostic version stamp and exit.
  --help, -h      Show this help and exit.

Exit codes:
  0  All scanned symlinks resolve (or neither directory exists).
  1  One or more symlinks remain broken after self-heal attempt, or
     pre-flight SSH check failed. Under --check-only, also: an installed
     hook that .claude/settings.json does not register (#231).
  2  Invalid invocation (e.g. unknown flag).

#
# Four of twelve audited consumers were in exactly that state for the refresh
# hook, pinned at one commit for over a week while the rest of the cohort moved
# through four skill versions (#167). Nothing detected it, because a
# half-installed hook is silent by construction: the missing half is the half
# that would have run.
#
# EVERY hook, not the one this check was written for (#224). It was hardcoded
# to skills-submodule-update.sh, so a consumer with three installed hooks and
# zero registrations had one of the three reported and the two init-socraticode
# hooks were undetectable. socraticode-health.sh is the worst one to lose that
# way — it is silent when clean by design, so "installed, unregistered, never
# runs" and "installed, registered, nothing to report" produce byte-identical
# observable behaviour. The repo that most needs the check is the one that
# cannot tell it stopped. Paired with #222, which deletes a registration
# silently, the two were a complete silent-failure loop.
#
# Reported HERE, for the same reason sync_self lives here — the doctor is the
# one code path that still runs in a repo whose hooks do not, whether through a
# reviewing-*/shipping-* preflight or a SessionStart entry of its own. Warn
# only; a wiring gap is not a dangling symlink and must not change this
# script's exit code, which Phase 1 preflights gate on with `|| exit 1`.

# #260 — version equality is a check on the STAMP, not on the content.
#
# #238's detector catches an override that has fallen BEHIND. It cannot catch
# divergence AT THE SAME VERSION, and #63 was reintroduced a second time through
# that opening: CannObserv/cannabis.observer-wordpress' shipping-work-php
# override recorded `version: "1.1"` against a vendor also at 1.1 — the doctor
# exited 0, correctly by its own contract — while its Step 1 had replaced
# upstream's `bash "<SKILL_SCRIPTS>/pre-ship.sh"` with `bash scripts/pre-ship.sh`
# for all six scripts. The stamp was honest; the content diverged underneath it.
# `version:` records the vendor version last synced from, and the failure mode
# is not "someone forgot to bump it" — it is "someone synced from 1.1 and, in
# the same edit, replaced upstream text with something worse".
#
# Divergence is also the EXPECTED state: an override exists to differ, so a
# check cannot simply diff and warn on any difference. What can be checked is a
# vendor's own claim about which fragments are not optional. Upstream fences
# those in its SKILL.md:
#
#   <!-- skill:required -->
#   ```bash
#   …the fragment…
#   ```
#
# The marker arms the fenced block that FOLLOWS it, and only a fenced block —
# prose gets legitimately reworded, and a fence is exactly delimited, so a
# fragment check over prose would flag every honest edit. An override must carry
# each armed block; anything else in the file is the override's own business.
#
# Compared whitespace-insensitively, because reflowing a code block is not
# dropping it. Absent a fence anywhere in the vendor file, this contributes
# nothing and says nothing: an upstream that marks nothing required is making no
# claim, which is different from an override that satisfies every claim made.
#
# #265 — the marker may name the fragment:
#
#   <!-- skill:required id=skill-scripts -->
#
# because an override can omit a fragment ON PURPOSE and the check had no way to
# hear that. A CannObserv/cli override of using-git-worktrees ships no scripts/
# at all — the project fixes the worktree root and enforces it from its own
# script — so the <SKILL_SCRIPTS> resolution loop resolves nothing there. Both
# offered remedies made that file worse: pasting the fragment back in puts a
# fence that cannot succeed into a skill file, which is the #63 shape arriving
# through the remedy, and "drop the override for per-file symlinks" has nothing
# to apply to when the whole delta IS SKILL.md. Meanwhile the check was already
# satisfiable by dead text — it is a whole-file substring search, so pasting the
# block under a "not used here" heading silenced it. The declaration is the
# honest version of that move, and check_silent_forks' .skills/forked-ok is the
# same escape hatch one check away.
#
# The id is what keeps the declaration from becoming a blanket mute: a
# declaration names the ONE fragment it excuses, so a fragment armed in a later
# release still reports against a file that already carries one. An un-idded
# marker cannot be declared at all — its vendor adds an id first. Each line is
# "<id>\t<fragment>", tab-delimited because the fragment is whitespace-collapsed
# and so can contain no tab of its own.
# The one arming form, shared with malformed_markers below so the two cannot
# drift into disagreeing about what a marker is.

  #
  # #266 — and NOT when the named path exists at the project root, because
  # `scripts/` there is also where a consumer keeps its OWN scripts and the

  # `scripts/setup-worktree.sh`, a project-owned script committed at that repo's
  # root, from a step that has just cd'd into a worktree — correct as written,
  # reported anyway, and with no correct substitution to offer, since
  # <SKILL_SCRIPTS> resolves to a skill directory and that override ships no
  # scripts/ at all. The doctor's cwd is the project root, so the
  # distinguishing fact is directly testable and precise in both directions: a
  # skill's scripts/X.sh does not exist at the project root, so #63's shape
  # still reports; a project's does, so a correct instruction stays quiet. It
  # also covers the copy the vendor already blesses — using-git-worktrees says
  # "a project-local scripts/ copy wins if one exists", which is a consumer copy
  # this check would have flagged the moment anyone spelled it out.
  #
  # It makes the check state-dependent — delete the project script later and the

# #238 — a local override is the one file the drift mitigations cannot reach.
# The auto-refresh hook moves the submodule pointer, which never touches a
# forked file; per-script symlinks track upstream for free; and the symlink
# scans skip regular directories by construction. So an override fell further
# behind on every release and the only detector was a consumer hitting a
# broken instruction: one sat at v1.2 against vendor's v1.4 and reintroduced
# #63's exact failure sixteen months after it was closed, because the file
# carrying the fix was the fork.
#
# The frontmatter already carries the machine-readable link, from the override
# recipe: `overrides:` names the vendor path and `version:` sits beside it.
# `version:` in an override records THE VENDOR VERSION LAST SYNCED FROM — not
# a version of the local file — bumped on every re-sync even when the local
# deltas are unchanged; the two readings diverge as soon as someone edits an
# override after syncing, which is an override's whole job. For a vendor that
# ships no version: at all, the `synced-from:` sibling key pins the vendor
# commit last synced from ("<repo> <tag> (<commit>)"), and the comparison is a
# diff between that commit and HEAD scoped to the skill's path — so a
# submodule bump that touches OTHER skills stays silent rather than training
# the reader to skim.
#
# Warn only, in every mode. Never an exit code — not even under --check-only,
# whose gate covers damage and wiring gaps (#231); drift is doc-sync debt the
# operator pays down on their schedule, and a probe that failed on it would
# push consumers toward deleting overrides rather than re-syncing them. Never

# #256 — a vendored file committed as a REGULAR FILE where a symlink was
# expected stops tracking upstream forever, and nothing detected it: not this
# doctor, not managing-skills, not the consumer's own tooling.
#
# Two vendoring shapes are in use across the cohort and they look identical
# from a shell, which is why this survived several sweeps:
#
#   - a whole-directory symlink at skills/<name> — everything beneath it is
#     upstream by construction, and nothing can drift;
#   - a real directory of PER-FILE symlinks — a change reaches it file by
#     file, so any one file committed as 100644/100755 silently opts out.
#
# The cost, measured: cannabis.observer-wordpress carried
# skills/shipping-work-php/scripts/doc-check.sh as a regular file among five
# symlinked siblings, still running the pre-#252 matcher, with its own tailored
# path list matching nothing — the exact bug #252 fixed, sitting undetected in
# the repo that had tailored the list most carefully. Three others carried a
# forked SKILL.md, so their scripts updated and the instructions describing
# them did not.
#
# Reported, never healed. A project-local divergence is sometimes deliberate,
# so the remedy is named and the operator decides. Two ways to say "deliberate":
# pre-ship.sh by name (upstream ships a stub for the bare variant, and
# docs/STYLE.md blesses a project-supplied wrapper), and a .skills/forked-ok
# list for anything else.
#
# Warn-only in every mode, including --check-only — same call as the override
# drift above it (#238). A fork is sync debt an operator pays down on their
# schedule, and a probe that failed on it would push consumers toward deleting
# the local file rather than declaring it.

doctor: the auth check above failed — auth to one of the submodule
remotes was refused. Common causes (and fixes):

  1. SSH agent not reachable from this shell.
       ssh-add -l
     "Error connecting to authentication agent" → start the agent and
     re-add keys.

  2. Agent has no identities loaded.
     Add the default key (macOS keychain integration):
       ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     (adjust the key path if yours isn't id_ed25519 — `ls ~/.ssh/id_*`
     shows what's available.)
     And persist via ~/.ssh/config so the key auto-loads:
       Host github.com
         AddKeysToAgent yes
         UseKeychain yes
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

  3. Auth works in your terminal but not from a wrapper script.
       ssh -T git@github.com
     If that succeeds interactively but fails here, a wrapper in the
     chain (e.g. dev.sh) is scrubbing SSH_AUTH_SOCK from the env.

  4. Public submodule, no SSH credentials available.
     Force HTTPS for github.com globally (affects ALL repos on this
     machine — use only if you understand the scope):
       git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf "git@github.com:"

doctor: SSH refused to talk to one of the submodule remotes because its
host key isn't in ~/.ssh/known_hosts. Trust the host key (verify the
fingerprint against the forge's published list first):

  ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

GitHub publishes its current host-key fingerprints at
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints —
compare the ssh-keyscan output before appending. For other forges, check
their docs for the equivalent.

    #     known_hosts. We run with StrictHostKeyChecking=yes
